  #x close to normal distribution, while y and z no.
  # z and y have outliers.
  #most of y values between (2.5,5)
  #x values between (3,10)
  #most of z values between (2.5,10)
  #I thank x and y are length and width, and z is depth.

#Explore the distribution of price. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising?
#(Hint: Carefully think about the binwidth and make sure you try a wide range of values.)
  ggplot(diamonds) + 
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price), binwidth = 20)
  #when I make binwidth to 20 the chart becomes more clear.
  # most of diamonds price  are less than 10000
  # have empty value in 1500

#How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat?
  diamonds%>%

  #1558
  diamonds %>%

#What do you think is the cause of the difference?
  #may because the diamond is expensive so a little material have much more value.
